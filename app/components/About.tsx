                    I’m Henry, a software engineer based in Brisbane who enjoys turning messy real-world systems
                    into clear, interactive tools.

                    Recently, I built a causal loop diagram GUI for my honours thesis, plus fitness and social
                    apps like Fortus and Buddy.

                    Outside of code, I’m into lifting, gaming, cars, and finding ways to automate boring stuff
                    in my daily routine.
